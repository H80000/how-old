# MSA 2019 Phase 1 - Web App Demo Practice
This repository was used to practice the web app module from phase 1 of MSA 2019. 

All material used are from their module.

The web app takes an image of human face and estimates their age. Visual Studio Code, Node.js, and React were used to create the web app and [deployed using Azure](https://how-old-msa-phase1.azurewebsites.net/).
